        <p>
            CrimeDB collects incident data from regions all across the country.
        </p>

        <p>
            The map of all crime inidents on the home page is but a small part
            of the information that is collected. Each region from which we
            collect data has a more in-depth view of the crime happening in the
            area, as well as internal data about the CrimeDB collection
            process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Check out details for the individual regions below.
        </p>
