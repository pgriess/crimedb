        This map shows crime frequency in {{name}} {{timeslice}}.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each square on the grid is colored according to how many crimes were
        reported to have occurred there. Grid cells with no color at all (i.e.
        black and white) are outside of the region for which data is collected.
        This means that there is a difference between cells that are known to
        have had no crimes and those for which we have no information. The
        legend in the bottom right of the map can be used to interpret these
        colors.
