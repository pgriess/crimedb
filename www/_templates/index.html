            CrimeDB is an easy-to-use database of crime incidents from around
            the USA.

            <b>Citizens</b> can use CrimeDB to view information about crime
            activity in their area, including which areas are more affected
            than others.  <b>Developers</b> can use CrimeDB data in their
            applications with its easy-to-use API. See the <a
            href="/developers">developers</a> page for more information.
