        <p>
            CrimeDB is intended to be an open repository of data for
            anyone to use. As such, all code is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/pgriess/crimedb">GitHub</a> and licensed under
            <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">ASL 2.0</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two ways to use this data: by using the
            <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">LeafletJS</a> plugin to overlay a a
            heatmap of crime data onto your map, or by downloading bulk data
            files from <tt>data.crimedb.org</tt>.
        </p>

        <h3>Using the LeafletJS plugin</h3>

        <p>
            The CrimeDB data can be easily overlaid on top of an existing
            <a href="https://leafletjs.com">LeafletJS</a> using only a few
            lines of JavaScript. It's as easy as:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//www.crimedb.org/js/crimedb-leaflet.js">&lt;/script>
...
map.addLayer(new crimedb.CrimeDBLayer());
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            Check out <a href="leaflet-example.html">this working example</a>
            and view source if you want a bit more information. It really is
            that simple.
        </p>

        <h3>Bulk data downloads</h3>

        <p>
            A list of all datasets available can be found by issuing a GET
            requset to <tt>http://data.crimedb.org/</tt>. This will return a
            JSON object describing the list of all valid datasets (regions).
        </p>

        <p>
            Individual datasets are hosted in subdirectories. For example,
            <tt>http://data.crimedb.org/stl/</tt>
            hosts the dataset for St. Louis City, MO. Issuing a GET request
            for this path will return metadata about this specific dataset
            in JSON format.
        </p>

        <p>
            Datasets are broken down into files for each month of
            data collected. For example,
            <tt>http://data.crimedb.org/stl/2014-01.json</tt>
            contains data for all crimes reported to have occurred in
            January of 2014 in St. Louis City, MO. This meat of this
            JSON object is a <tt>crimes</tt> array, with each of
            the elements containing the following fields:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><tt>description</tt> -- freeform textual description of the
                                        crime</li>
            <li><tt>time</tt> -- time the crime occurred, in UTC epoch seconds</li>
            <li><tt>location</tt> -- a <a
            href="http://www.geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> entity describing the
            location of the crime
        </ul>
    </body>
