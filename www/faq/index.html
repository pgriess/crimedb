        <h2>What do un-colored squares on the map mean?</h2>
        <p>
            Squares on the map that have no color indicate that we don't have
            any data for that area. This is different than areas for which we
            know that no crimes have occurred -- these areas are rendered in
            blue.
        </p>

        <h2>What crimes are represented on the map?</h2>
        <p>
            All reported crimes from January 1 2014 - January 1 2015.
        </p>

        <h2>Why isn't there any data in my area?</h2>
        <p>
            This is most likely because CrimeDB doesn't know how to collect
            data from your local police department. Send mail to
            <a href="mailto:info@crimedb.org">info@crimedb.org</a> or tweet at
            <a href="http://twitter.com/pgriess">@pgriess</a> to tell me
            what's missing and I'll try to get it added.
        </p>

        <h2>Where does CrimeDB get its data?</h2>
        <p>
            Our data is automatically compiled from police jurisdictions from
            around the country. It is made available to anyone for use using
            the <a href="/developers">CrimeDB API</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>This is awesome. How can I help?</h2>
        <p>
            Get in touch with me and we'll figure something out. There are a
            ton of things that I could use help with, including both technical
            and non-technical work.
        </p>

        <h2>I have more questions. How can I contact you?</h2>
        <p>
            Send mail to <a href="mailto:info@crimedb.org">info@crimedb.org</a>
            or tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/pgriess">@pgriess</a>.
