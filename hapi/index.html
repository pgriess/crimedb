        <p>
            CrimeDB is a searchable database of crime data with an easy-to-use
            HTTP JSON API. At the moment, its database consists of more than
            individual 300,000 crimes from the <a
            href="http://www.slmpd.org/">St Louis Metropolitan Police
            Department</a> from April 2008 - May 2013. Please feel free to use
            this data however you see fit. If you come up with anything cool,
            let me know at <a href="http://twitter.com/pgriess">@pgriess</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>API</h2>

        <p>
            The API is pretty simple to use. Just issue <tt>GET</tt> requests
            to <tt>http://api.crimedb.org/crimes</tt> and you'll get back JSON
            data with the following fields:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><tt>description</tt> -- freeform textual description of the
                                        crime</li>
            <li><tt>time</tt> -- time the crime occurred, in UTC epoch seconds</li>
            <li><tt>location</tt> -- a <a
            href="http://www.geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> entity describing the
            location of the crime
        </ul>

        <p>
            Requests to the <tt>/crimes</tt> URL support some query parameters
            that shape how results are returned:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><tt>description=TTT</tt> -- filter results to only those whose
            description contains the given text
            <li><tt>time=[NNN:MMM]</tt> -- filter results to only those
            that occurred between NNN and MMM UTC epoch seconds</li>
            <li><tt>location=[&lt;lat1&gt;,&lt;lon1&gt;:&lt;lat2&gt;,&lt;lon2&gt;]</tt>
            -- filter results to only those that occurred within the bounding
            box described by the two points</li>
            <li><tt>limit=NNN</tt> -- limit the number of results returned</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As an example, to retrieve all crimes that occurred on January 1,
            2013 CST, you would ask for crimes between 1357020000 and
            1357106400 by setting the <tt>time</tt> query paramter like so:
            <tt>time=[1357020000:1357106400]</tt>.
