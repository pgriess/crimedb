            This form allows one to upload an
            <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML">OpenStreetMap XML</a>
            file and view a single relation on a map. The goal is to
            provide a tool for helping to one to select the correct
            relation from an OSM file. As a secondary goal, debugging
            path issues is possible by using the slider at the bottom
            of the screen to incrementally draw the path, with points
            written out to the JavaScript console.
